# Sigma-Point-Kalman-Filter

I hope to give a comprehensive and easy-use sigma point kalman filter algorithms.

I will be writting and collecting all sigma-point-based Kalman filter algorithms.

If you have some good implementation, please feel free to contact me via frank.fanxinqi (AT) outlook.com.

If the code I update has copyright which I did not declare, please do not hesitate to contact me as well.
